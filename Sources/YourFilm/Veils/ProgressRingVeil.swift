     Must be a non-negative value. If this value falls below `minValue` it will be
     clamped and set equal to `minValue`.

     This cannot be used to get the value while the ring is animating, to get
     current value while animating use `currentValue`.

     The current value of the progress ring after animating, use startProgress(value:)
     to alter the value with the option to animate and have a completion handler.
